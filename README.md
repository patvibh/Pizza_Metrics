# Pizza_Metrics: A Data Analysis Case Study
## Description: 
In this project, I have worked with the Pizza Runner database schema provided by Danny, the owner of Pizza Runner. The schema contains tables with data on customers, runners, orders, and pizzas. The goal of this project was to clean and analyze the data to help Danny optimize Pizza Runner's operations.

To accomplish this, I first familiarized myself with the entity relationship diagram and the structure of the tables. Then, I cleaned the data by identifying and handling missing or inconsistent values. After cleaning the data, I used SQL queries to answer a series of questions related to Pizza Runner's operations, such as calculating the average distance traveled by runners and identifying the most popular pizza toppings.

Finally, I provided recommendations to Danny based on my analysis to help him optimize his business operations and improve customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to optimize business operations and improve decision-making.
